* * Based on the results, Self-Awareness I got 18, Self-Management I got 17, Social awareness I got 22, and Relationship management I got 18. Due to those results, it looks like I need the most improvement in Self-management, which can be done by prioritizing tasks, scheduling breaks, and regularly reflecting on my progress. On the other hand, looks like my biggest strength is social awareness, which means I can understand and connect with others, fostering positive relationships and empathy. Moreover, from what I've seen, Emotional Intelligence is a key priority in Tech.
* [Assess your biases. If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)
* * From the results I have recieved, I see that my score is quite high, 104/120, meaning I have high self awareness, curiosity, and courage, which is very positive. However, I can see my weakest score is on the "Bias and the Brain", while my strongest happens to be "Bias and Identity". From my score in "Identity", I can tell I stand strongly with inclusivity and feel everyone can be the same, regardless of Identity. However, in my score in "Brain", I am well aware I need to work harder to get things done independently.
