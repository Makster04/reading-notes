# [Readings: Chart.js, Canvas](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-201d108/tree/main/class-12)
## JavaScript Canvas
1. **What does the <.canvas.> allow a developer to acheive?** The element in HTML allows a developer to create dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It provides a blank rectangular area where JavaScript can draw graphics, making it useful for creating visualizations, games, and other interactive content on web pages.
2. **What is the importance of the closing `</.canvas.> tag?** It marks the end of the canvas element's definition. It ensures proper HTML syntax and signifies the completion of the canvas area. Failing to include this closing tag can lead to rendering issues or unexpected behavior in the web page.
3. **Explain what the getContext() method does.** The method in JavaScript retrieves the rendering context and its drawing functions for a specified canvas element. It allows developers to access methods and properties that facilitate drawing and manipulation of graphics on the canvas. The method typically takes one argument, which specifies the type of context desired (e.g., "2d" for a 2D context or "webgl" for a WebGL context).

## Chart.js Documentation:
1. **What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?** It is a JavaScript library used for creating interactive and visually appealing charts on web pages.
