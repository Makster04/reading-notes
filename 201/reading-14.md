## Discussion Questions
1. **What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**
* ***Trust:*** Team members trust each other and feel safe to express themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal.
* ***Open Communication:*** There is open and honest communication among team members, where opinions, ideas, and concerns are freely shared and respected.
* ***Supportive Environment:*** The team fosters a supportive atmosphere where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning and growth, and individuals feel empowered to take risks and innovate.
3. **Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.** In a previous professional setting, the team I was part of lacked psychological safety due to a hierarchical structure that stifled open communication and innovation. Decisions were made at the top without input from team members, leading to a lack of trust and engagement. Mistakes were often punished rather than seen as opportunities for improvement, creating a culture of fear and reluctance to take risks.
4. **What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?** Teams operating with a high degree of psychological safety have a positive impact on their company and team members. They experience increased creativity, collaboration, and innovation as individuals feel empowered to share ideas and take calculated risks. This leads to higher productivity, better problem-solving, and ultimately, improved performance for the company. Additionally, team members report higher job satisfaction, lower stress levels, and greater overall well-being when they feel psychologically safe, resulting in better retention rates and a more positive work culture.
