## Domain Modeling
1. **Explain why we need domain modeling.** It is a crucial step in software development that involves creating a representation of the problem space  in the form of a conceptual model.

## HTML Table Basics
1. **Why should tables not be used for page layouts?** Tables are intended for displaying tabular data, not for structuring page layouts. 
2. **List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.**
* ***<thead>:*** Represents the header of a table. It is used to group the header content in a table.
* ***<tbody>:*** Groups the body content in a table. It is separate from the header and footer and contains the main content rows.
* ***<tfoot>:*** Represents the footer of a table. It is used to group the footer content in a table.

## Introducing Constructors
1. **What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?** A special method in a class or object that is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. The advantages of using it include code reusability and ensuring that an object is in a valid state upon creation.
2. **How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?** In an object literal, "this" refers to the object itself, representing the current instance of the object. It also refers to the current instance of the object being created, but it is used within the context of the constructor function to refer to the new object being instantiated.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
1. **Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.** Cannot think of a very good example from my experience but
2. I assume for a manufacturer, a product is like an object created based on that blueprint.
3. If you update the blueprint, all products derived from it automatically inherit those changes.
4. Similarly, in JavaScript, prototypes define shared properties and methods for objects,
5. and inheritance allows objects to inherit from prototypes, reflecting changes made to the prototype in all instances.
