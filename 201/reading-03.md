# [Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-201d108/tree/main/class-03)

# Learn HTML
## Ordered and Unordered lists.
1. **When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?** When you're not ranking anything or put them in any order
2. **How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?** The 'list-style-type' property is used to define the type of marker or bullet for list items
3. **When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?** Depends on the logical structure and hierarchy of the information you are presenting
4. **Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**
   * You can use the 'list-style-type' property to change the style.
   * Use the 'list-style' property along with the 'counter' and 'content' properties to customize numbers.

# Learn CSS
## The Box Model.
1. **Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?** "In the web kingdom, Benny, a special box, discovered Margin's power to guard personal space and Padding's ability to provide comfort. Together, they shaped Benny's destiny in the enchanting tale of "The Box Model," creating harmony and balance in the HTML realm."
2. **List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**
   * **Content**: The innermost part of the box that holds the actual content, such as text, images, or other HTML elements.
   * **Padding**: The space between the content and the border. 
   * **Border**: The border surrounds the padding and content.
   * **Margin**: The outermost part of the box, creating space outside the border.

# Learn JS
## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.
1. **What data types can you store inside of an Array?** Arrays can store a variety of data types (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, & other arrays).
2. **Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?** Yes, its a valid array. It's a two-dimensional one including subarrays, each representing info about an individual. To access values, you have to use indices for both the outer and inner arrays.
3. **List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**
   * **Assignment (=):** The operator assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
   * **Addition Assignment (+=)**: Adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
   * **Subtraction Assignment (-=)**: Subtracts the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
   * **Multiplication Assignment (*=)**: Multiplies the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
   * **Division Assignment (/=)**: Divides the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.
4. **Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.** This would result into 10dog because its asking us to add A, which is 10, to B, which is false, to c which is the word dog.
5. **Describe a real-world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.** Calculate Weather conditions and temperatures.
6. **Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.** A time a loop is useful is when you need to repat over an array to perform a specific action on each element
