## Introduction To Events.
1. **How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?** Events are user actions (like clicks or keypresses) triggering specific website functions. They make web pages interactive by allowing dynamic responses to user interactions.
2. **When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?** Use addEventListener() by providing the event type and the function to execute when the event occurs. This method enables flexible assignment of behaviors to specific events.
3. **Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?** The event object holds details about an event, including its type and the triggering element. The target within the event object is valuable as it points to the specific element that initiated the event, facilitating easy access and manipulation.
4. **What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?** Event bubbling propagates from the target to the root of the DOM, while event capturing moves from the root to the target. These phases control the order in which event handlers execute, influencing how events are handled in the DOM hierarchy.
