# [Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-201d108/tree/main/class-06)
## JavaScript Object Basics
1. **How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**  An object is like a container holding info. Think of a car as an object - properties like color, model, and speed. Each property provides specific details.
2. **What are some advantages to creating object literals?** Object literals organize data, enhancing readability, organization, reusability, and easy modification. They group related information and simplify code maintenance.
3. **How do objects differ from arrays?**  Objects use key-value pairs for named properties; arrays use ordered lists by index. Objects suit data with named properties, arrays for ordered lists.
4. **Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.** Bracket notation is used when a property name is dynamic or contains special characters, e.g., person['first name'] instead of person.first name.
5. **Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?** In the code, this refers to the current object (dog). It dynamically accesses properties, promoting reusability and flexibility across different instances of the object.

## Introduction To The DOM
1. **What is the DOM?** The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree of objects, enabling dynamic access and manipulation of document content through programming languages like JavaScript.
2. **Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.** JavaScript interacts with the DOM, acting as the bridge between a web page and its dynamic behavior. It allows scripts to access, modify, and update the content and structure of a document, enabling dynamic and interactive web experiences.
