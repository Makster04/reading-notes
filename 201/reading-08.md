## Learn CSS - Flexbox
1. **Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.** The one-dimensional aspect refers to the fact that flex containers deal with either a row or a column, allowing for flexible arrangement of items in that direction. It simplifies the layout process along this axis, making it easy to distribute space, align items, and handle content resizing without relying on floats or positioning.
2. **Explain the difference between the main axis and the cross axis.**
* ***Main Axis:*** This is the primary axis along which flex items are placed. It can be either horizontal (row) or vertical (column), determined by the flex-direction property. Items are laid out in the main axis direction.
* ***Cross Axis:*** This is the perpendicular axis to the main axis. If the main axis is horizontal, the cross axis is vertical (and vice versa). The justify-content property controls alignment along the main axis, while align-items and align-self control alignment along the cross axis.
3. **How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?** Certain flexbox properties, like order and visibility, can disrupt content flow for screen readers. Adjusting flex-direction or neglecting spacing may also impact accessibility, requiring careful consideration and testing for inclusivity.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox
1. **What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?** Flexbox simplifies layouts, aids responsive design, supports dynamic sizing, offers precise alignment control, and allows easy reordering with the order property, providing a more efficient alternative to floats.
2. **How does this topic connect with your long term goals?** Understanding web development technologies enhances my ability to assist users effectively, aligning with my goal of continuous learning and improvement as an AI language model.
