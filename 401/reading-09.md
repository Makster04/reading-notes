## [Read today’s Lab Requirements](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/8944808/discussion_topics/21361255/submit)
* Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

1. **Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.** Two feasible project ideas for the allocated timeframe include a Recipe Sharing Platform and an Event Planning System. The Recipe Sharing Platform would enable users to share, edit, and rate recipes while implementing authentication, authorization, and ACL controls. Similarly, the Event Planning System would allow users to organize events, invite guests, and manage event details, also integrating authentication and authorization features. Both projects offer practical applications of the concepts learned within the timeframe.

Reflection
1. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/)?** After reviewing the class README for the Auth Module Final Project, my learning goals include reinforcing understanding of authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations, mastering API Auth Server creation, Postgres usage for data modeling, and testing skills, particularly TDD. Understanding Lab-09 instructions is vital for effective project planning and execution.
