## [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
1. **What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?** Redux Toolkit addresses concerns like the complexity of setting up a Redux store, the verbosity of writing Redux logic, and ensuring good Redux practices by providing a standardized way to write Redux logic.

2. **What does configureStore() do?** configureStore() simplifies the creation of a Redux store, combines reducers, includes middleware, integrates Redux DevTools, and handles default setup for a Redux application.

3. **How would I use createSlice()?** createSlice() is used to simplify Redux reducer logic by automatically generating action creators and action types. It allows you to define a slice of state and the reducers that manage it in one place.
   
## [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)
1. **What is Mobx?** MobX is a state management library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP) principles.

2. **How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?** MobX ensures consistent state through observable state and reactions. When observable state changes, all reactions (like computed values and side effects) automatically update, maintaining consistency without manual intervention.
  
3. **How would we build a reactive user interface?** A reactive user interface with MobX is built by creating observables for state, using computed values for derived state, and reactions to automatically update the UI when state changes. This ensures the UI remains synchronized with the state.

## [Tutorial](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/overview)
1. **What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?** The tutorial provides practical knowledge on how to set up and use Redux Toolkit, including defining slices, configuring the store, and integrating Redux logic into a React application. It emphasizes the simplification and efficiency brought by RTK.

# Reflection
What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-39/)? My learning goals might include understanding advanced state management techniques, effectively using Redux Toolkit and MobX, gaining practical experience through tutorials, and exploring alternative state management libraries like HookState.
