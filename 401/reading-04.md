## [nosql vs sql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
1. **What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?** SQL databases excel due to structured data and powerful query capabilities.
2. **What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?** NoSQL databases, with their flexible schema, suit hierarchical data storage better.
3. **Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.** SQL databases scale vertically (more powerful hardware), while NoSQL scales horizontally (more servers).

## [sql modeling techniques](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-7-simplified-data-modeling/)
1. **Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?**  : Data tables link with a foreign key in the "many" table referencing the primary key in the "one" table.
2. **Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.** Prior to design, create an entity-relationship diagram detailing tables and their connections.
3. **Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.** Primary key uniquely identifies a record, while foreign key links records in different tables.

1. **How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?** Keywords structured queries, while parameters personalize them, enhancing flexibility and security.
2. **Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.** Organizing data efficiently across tables to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity.
3. **Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.** One-to-one links one record to another, one-to-many connects one record to multiple, many-to-many associates many records with many others.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-04/)? Data modeling in JavaScript involves encoding real-world concepts, SQL operations, and Sequelize for efficient database interactions.
