# [Reading: React Native](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d59/tree/main/class-41)

## [getting started with react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started))
1. **Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.** Core Components include View, Text, and Image. View acts as a container, Text displays text, and Image renders images. These components form the basic UI elements in React Native apps.
2. **What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?** React Native allows developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React, yet the apps produced run natively on both iOS and Android platforms. This approach streamlines cross-platform development, hence "native" in its name.
3. **What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?** React Native's building blocks include components like View, Text, and Image, similar to React. However, React Native uses different rendering engines for iOS and Android, leveraging native UI components, unlike React which renders to HTML.
   
## [expo](https://expo.dev/accounts/makster_04)
1. **What solution does expo provide?** Expo simplifies mobile app development by providing a suite of tools and services. It streamlines processes like building, deploying, and managing apps, offering a more efficient development workflow.
2. **Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.** Expo is referred to as the "fastlane" workflow because it aims to handle much of the app development complexity, allowing developers to focus on writing code and rapidly iterating on their projects.
3. **What is the difference between React Native and Expo?** React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, while Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native to streamline development. Expo adds additional layers of abstraction and provides more pre-built components and services compared to React Native alone.

## [expo snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)

1. **Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?** Snack is a tool that enables developers to quickly prototype, test, and share React Native code in the browser. It provides an online IDE where developers can write React Native code and see the results instantly without setting up a local development environment.

## [ejecting](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/expokit/eject)
1. **What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?** "Ejecting" in Expo refers to the process of converting an Expo project into a standard React Native project. This action provides developers with full access to the underlying native code, allowing for more customization and flexibility in the development process.
2. **When should you not eject?** Ejecting should be avoided if you prefer to continue leveraging Expo's managed workflow, which abstracts away much of the native development complexity. It's also not recommended if you're unfamiliar with native development tools and processes.
3. **Why might you choose to eject?** Ejecting may be chosen to gain more control over the native codebase, access to certain native modules not supported by Expo, or to integrate third-party libraries that require native code modifications.
