# [Readings: AWS: Cloud Servers](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d59/tree/main/class-16)

## [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
1. **What is an EC2 Instance?** An EC2 Instance is a virtual server in the cloud provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
2. **Name 2 use cases for EC2.** EC2 instances are commonly used for web hosting and application development/testing.
3. **Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.** ECS provides more flexibility and control over the infrastructure compared to managed services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.

## [EC2 For Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)
1. **Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?** EC2 can be found under the "Compute" section in the AWS Management Console.
2. **Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.** T2 Micro instances are smaller and suitable for low-resource applications, while XL instances are larger and offer more resources for demanding workloads.
3. **Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.** A compute cycle is like a worker completing a task. Imagine a factory worker assembling a product: each time they complete one assembly, that's a compute cycle.


## [Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)
1. **What is Elastic Beanstalk?** Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that simplifies the deployment and management of applications by automatically handling the provisioning of resources.
2. **Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.** Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to deploy and run applications, managing the infrastructure and scaling as needed.
3. **Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.** Benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk include simplified deployment, automatic scaling, built-in monitoring, and easy integration with other AWS services.
