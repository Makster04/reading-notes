#  [Reading: API Integration](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d59/tree/main/class-34)

## [Review API Server Build](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/8944808/discussion_topics/21361238/submit)
1. **Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.** A query string parameter appears after the ? in a URL and is used for filtering, sorting, or passing optional parameters, such as in http://example.com/resource?param=value. In contrast, a path parameter is embedded directly in the URL path to specify a particular resource or identifier, as seen in http://example.com/resource/value.
2. **What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:**
* API URL: http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things
3. **We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.**  Our dynamic API is like a versatile key for a mansion. The "interface" key magically adjusts to unlock different doors, allowing access to various rooms. This adaptable feature simplifies navigation, eliminating the need for separate keys and making exploration of the mansion effortless.


## Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named.
* [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)
* [react-cookies component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)
1. **Describe some react-cookie features.** The react-cookie library offers cookie management functions, hooks for easy use in functional components, server-side support, and TypeScript definitions.
2. **Describe some react-cookies features.** The react-cookies component provides methods for cookie management, automatic state synchronization with cookies, context API support, and browser compatibility.
3. **Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?** Preferred Library: react-cookie (Convenient useCookies hook, Better server-side rendering support, Built-in TypeScript definitions for enhanced type safety)

## [Review Auth Server Build](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/8944808/discussion_topics/21361238/submit)
1. **Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.** Middleware in Express.js verifies credentials sent in request headers for basic auth and validates tokens provided in the Authorization header for bearer auth.
2. **Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.** OAuth involves redirecting users to an authorization endpoint, where they authenticate and authorize a client app. Upon approval, the app receives an authorization code, which it exchanges for access and refresh tokens.
3. **Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.** RBAC assigns users roles like keys for different levels of access in a building. Each role grants specific permissions, ensuring users access only what's necessary for their responsibilities, similar to how keys open different doors based on their type.
