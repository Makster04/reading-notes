## [React Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
1. **What are the building blocks of a React app?** The building blocks of a React app include components, which are reusable and encapsulated pieces of code.
2. **What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?** HTML elements are predefined, while React components are custom elements defined by developers.
3. **What is JSX and why do we use it?** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML elements and React components in the same file. It's used to describe what the UI should look like.
4. **Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.** JavaScript expressions can be embedded in JSX using curly braces {}.
5. **Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?** React has special features like map() for iteration and conditional rendering for conditional logic.
6. **How does React know to respond to a user’s inputs?** React responds to user inputs through event handlers.
7. **What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?** The word that indicates a React component manages data with a Hook is "useState".
8. **How can two react components share data?** React components can share data by passing props from parent to child components or by using a state management library like Redux.

## [Render and Commit](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit)
1. **What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?**
2. **How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?**
3. **Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?**
4. **After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?**

## Additional Questions
1. **Note the naming conventions in the [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/#naming). What pattern(s) do you see?**
* The Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide offers concise rules for structured React and JSX code, covering component organization, naming, spacing, and event handling. It recommends single components per file, clear naming, proper prop usage, and discourages mixins. It suggests using arrow functions for events and constructor binding. These guidelines ensure clarity and consistency in React projects.
2. **Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
* I look forward to learning how to Whiteboard more
3. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-26/)?**
* My goals after reading the class README are to understand React's component-based UI, master SASS features, and efficiently manage state in applications. I plan to start React projects using Vite and codesandbox.io, create styled components, handle events, and update state effectively. Overall, I aim to apply React's principles adeptly in web development.
