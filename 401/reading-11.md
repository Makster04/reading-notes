# [Readings: Event Driven Applications](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d59/tree/main/class-11)

## [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)
1. **What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?** Node.js simplifies Event Driven Programming with its built-in events module, allowing developers to create, emit, and handle events seamlessly.
2. **What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?** Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles complement Event Driven Programming by providing a structured approach to organizing code. With OOP, developers can encapsulate behavior within objects, promoting modularity and maintainability.
3. **Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.** Imagine you're chatting with friends on a messaging app. Each time someone sends a message, an event is triggered. On the backend, Node.js can use event-driven programming to handle these events efficiently. For example:
* - When a message is received, Node.js can emit an event signaling the arrival of a new message.
* - Event listeners can then process these events, perhaps by storing the message in a database, notifying other users, or performing other relevant actions.
* - By using event-driven architecture, Node.js can handle multiple simultaneous connections and events efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications like chat apps, streaming services, or IoT systems where responsiveness and scalability are crucial.

## Additional Questions
1. **Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-3), What do you look forward to learning?** As much I was satisfied with what I learned about the backend, I look forward to seeing whatever we will learn about the frontend.
2. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-11/)?** The class dives into Event Driven Applications in JavaScript, covering core concepts like JavaScript events, event-driven architecture, and the Observer pattern via Publish/Subscribe. Students grasp the significance of events in UI interactions and backend processes, gaining skills in emitting and handling events to build modular, event-based systems. Ultimately, the class aims to empower students to proficiently employ event-driven programming in JavaScript applications.
