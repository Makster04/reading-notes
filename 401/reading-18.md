## [AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/guides/amazon-api-gateway)
1. **What is Amazon API Gateway?**
* Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service provided by AWS that makes it easy to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, making it easier to build and deploy serverless applications.
2. **Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?**
* Amazon API Gateway plays a crucial role in the serverless ecosystem by providing a managed solution for creating and managing APIs without needing to provision or manage any servers. It seamlessly integrates with AWS Lambda, allowing developers to build serverless applications that can automatically scale based on demand, reducing operational overhead and costs.
3. **How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?**
* API Gateway integrates seamlessly with various AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and more. This allows you to build powerful serverless applications by connecting your APIs to other AWS resources without writing additional code. API Gateway can also be used with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to secure your APIs and control access to resources.

## [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
1. **What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?**
* Easy API Creation, Security, Monitoring and Logging, and Integration
2. **What two API types might you choose from?**
* You can choose between REST APIs and WebSocket APIs when creating APIs with Amazon API Gateway.

## [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
1. **Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.**
* DynamoDB is like a giant, fast, and reliable electronic filing cabinet in the cloud. Imagine you have a massive collection of items you want to store, like books in a library. DynamoDB lets you store and retrieve these items quickly, and you can also search for specific items based on certain attributes. It's designed to handle large amounts of data and can scale automatically to accommodate more data as your collection grows.

## [Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction)
1. **What is Dynamoose?**
* Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon DynamoDB, designed to simplify the process of working with DynamoDB in Node.js applications. It provides an elegant and straightforward way to define and manage DynamoDB data models using a simple and familiar API.
2. **What are some key features of Dynamoose?**
* Some key features would be:
* **Schema Definition:** Define data models using a schema, similar to traditional ORM frameworks.
* **Type Checking:** Automatically validates data types before saving to DynamoDB.
* **Middleware Support:** Supports middleware functions for customizing and extending model behavior.
* **Query Building:** Provides a fluent API for building complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
* **Integration with Promises:** Built-in support for Promises for asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with asynchronous code.

## Reflection
1. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-18/)?**
* After reviewing the class README, my goals are to understand AWS components like Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda, learn the differences between HTTP and REST APIs, and develop skills in creating and managing APIs using API Gateway. I aim to master DynamoDB operations through Lambda functions and become proficient in using Dynamoose for simplifying database interactions. Additionally, I plan to grasp IAM role management, implement serverless applications, and learn monitoring techniques with AWS CloudWatch.
