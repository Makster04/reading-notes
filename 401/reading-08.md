## [5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/security/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)
1. **What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?** RBAC is explained as a method for managing access to resources based on roles rather than individual user permissions. It emphasizes its importance in simplifying access control management and enhancing security.
2. **Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.** It suggests implementing a hierarchical structure where roles are assigned specific permissions based on their level of authority. This hierarchy ensures that access control is organized and efficient.
3. **What approach might you take to implement RBAC?** The article recommends a five-step approach for implementing RBAC, which involves defining roles, assigning permissions to roles, determining user-role assignments, enforcing access controls, and regularly reviewing and updating the RBAC system.


## [wiki- RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
1. **If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?** It defines authorization as the process of determining what actions or operations a user is allowed to perform after they have been authenticated.
2. **Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.** Three primary rules of RBAC are named: Role Assignment, Role Authorization, and Permission Authorization. These rules govern the assignment and usage of roles and permissions within the RBAC framework.
3. **Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.** RBAC, or Role-Based Access Control, is a system where access to resources like files or applications is determined by the role a user has in an organization. Instead of granting permissions directly to users, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to those roles.

   
## [RBAC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NP8Eon3cA)
1. **What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.** Access rights, or authorization, in RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) are associated with roles, not individual users. When a user successfully authenticates or logs in, their access rights are activated based on the role they are assigned.
2. **Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?** Access rights or authorization are activated after a user successfully authenticates or logs in.
3. **Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.** RBAC can benefit a business by providing a more structured and manageable approach to access control. It simplifies the administration of permissions by assigning roles to users, allowing for easier management of access rights across the organization. This can enhance security, streamline processes, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## Reflection

1. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-08/)?** 
The README covers authentication, authorization, and access control in web apps. It emphasizes roles, capabilities, and implementing access control middleware in Node.js. It discusses managing access controls in backend and frontend layers using tools like Express Middleware.
