# [Reading: Application State with Redux](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-javascript-401d59/tree/main/class-36)

## [Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials](https://egghead.io/courses/fundamentals-of-redux-course-from-dan-abramov-bd5cc867)
1. **What is the first principle of Redux?**
* The first principle of Redux is that the state of the entire application is stored in a single, centralized store.
2. **What is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?**
* A store holds the application's state. Reducers are used to update the store by specifying how the state changes in response to actions.
3. **Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.**
* 1. ***getState():*** Retrieves the current state.
* 2. ***dispatch(action):*** Dispatches an action to change the state.
* 3. ***subscribe(listener):*** Registers a listener to be called on state changes
4. **Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.**
* ***combineReducers()*** combines multiple reducer functions into one, managing different parts of the state. This modular approach makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
