## “Growth Mindset”

- **"Growth Mindset":** is the belief that the more you work, learn, and study, the more you empower your abilities and skills in whatever you're studying or doing. 
* **3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:** To keep myself in a growth mindset, I have to **apply myself to challenges**, since that helps with resiliance and motivation, **embrace failures**, since the more you repeat it, the more you learn the task in had, and **do not compare your level of skill to others** because that may put you in the stage of fear where you'll have trouble trying to focus on the task of hand you want to empower in.
