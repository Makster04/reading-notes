### About "Growth Mindset"
- **- "Growth Mindset" Definition:** Its the belief that the more you work, learn, and study, the more you empower your abilities and skills in whatever you're studying or doing. 
* **- Three Pillars of a "Growth Mindset":** To keep myself in a growth mindset, I have to:
- ***1) Apply Myself to Challenges***, since that helps with resilience and motivation,
- ***Embrace Failures***, since the more you repeat it, the more you learn the task in had, and ***Do Not Compare my Level of Skill to Others*** because that may put you in the stage of fear where you'll have trouble trying to focus on the task of hand you want to empower in.
