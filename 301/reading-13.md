## [Crud Basics](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88)
1. **Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?** To update a record through an API, you would typically use the HTTP method PUT. Alternatively, you can use the PATCH method for partial updates.
2. **Which REST methods require an ID parameter?**
* **GET:** When retrieving a specific resource, you often need to provide the ID of the resource you want to retrieve.
* **PUT:** When updating a resource, you need to specify the ID of the resource you want to update.
* **DELETE:** When deleting a resource, you need to specify the ID of the resource you want to delete.

## [Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)
1. **Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?** The relationship between REST (Representational State Transfer) and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) lies in the fact that RESTful APIs often utilize CRUD operations to interact with resources. RESTful APIs typically map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to CRUD operations, allowing clients to perform actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.
2. **If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**
* a. Designing API Endpoints: Determine the resources that the API will expose and define their endpoints.
* b. Choosing HTTP Methods: Assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to each endpoint based on the CRUD operations they represent.
* c. Implementing Server Logic: Develop the backend logic to handle incoming requests to the API endpoints, including data validation, processing, and database interactions.
* d. Handling Errors: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide informative responses for various scenarios such as invalid requests or server errors.
* e. Testing and Documentation: Test the API thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected and document its usage, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and any authentication mechanisms.
