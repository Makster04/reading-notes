## [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)
1. **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?** Alongside the decline of women in computer science, there was a significant cultural shift in the marketing of personal computers. This shift occurred during the 1980s when home computers became more common, and these computers were often marketed as toys for boys, emphasizing video games and programming.
2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because this early exposure gave them a head start in computer literacy and programming skills. As personal computers became more prevalent in households, boys were more likely to have access to them and therefore more opportunity to develop these skills, contributing to the growing gender disparity in computer science.

## [ Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)
1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?** Diversity efforts are most successful when they are integrated into the company's overall business strategy and culture, rather than being treated as a separate initiative or afterthought.
2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?** Diverse companies perform better for several reasons. Firstly, diverse teams bring a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and ideas to the table, leading to more innovative solutions to complex problems. Additionally, diverse companies are better equipped to understand and meet the needs of diverse customer bases, leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, a diverse workforce can enhance employee morale, engagement, and retention, contributing to overall company success.
3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.** An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is illustrated by the development of inclusive design practices in technology products. For instance, companies like Apple have integrated accessibility features into their products, such as VoiceOver for visually impaired users and Switch Control for users with mobility impairments. By considering the needs of diverse users during the design and development process, these companies create products that are more accessible and usable by a wider range of people, ultimately enhancing their market reach and impact.
