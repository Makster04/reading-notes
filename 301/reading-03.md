## [React Docs - lists and keys){:target=”_blank”}](
1. **What does .map() return?** The .map() function in React returns a new array with transformed elements based on the provided function.
2. **If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?** To loop through an array and display each value in JSX in React, you can use the .map() function inside curly braces {} within your JSX code.
3. **Each list item needs a unique ____.** Each list item needs a unique ***"key" attribute.***
4. **What is the purpose of a key?** The purpose of a key in React is to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list, allowing it to efficiently update the UI. Keys should be unique identifiers for each element in the list.

## [The Spread Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
1. **What is the spread operator?** The spread operator (...) is a syntactic feature in JavaScript used for expanding elements, such as arrays or objects, into places where multiple elements or key-value pairs are expected.
2. **List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**
* Expand arrays into individual elements.
* Copy arrays and objects.
* Merge arrays and objects.
* Pass elements of an iterable (like an array) as arguments to a function or constructor.
4. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**
// const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
// const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
// const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
// console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
5. **Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**
6. **Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**
